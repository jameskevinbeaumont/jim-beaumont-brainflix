### Sprint-1

Completed and submitted on time. A couple of minor changes since then.

### Sprint-2

Submitted on time but noticed yesterday (12/22/2020) that I forgot my
H1 tag so decided to add it. Feel free to grade based on the previous
submission but I did want to make that minor correction and ensure that
my git status was up to date.

### Sprint-3

All sprint-3 requirements completed.

Note regarding the "Upload Video" page. I took the liberty of adding an 
"Upload Image" and "Upload Video" section (per Jon's OK) so the user
can upload a thumbnail image as well as the actual video. The caveat here
is that the image needs to be in the assets/images folder and the video
needs to be in the assets/video folder. Unfortunately I was unable to figure
out how to determine the video duration BEFORE the video is actually loaded
so I had to manually update the video duration times in the .json file that
holds the actual data. I would love to know how to do that and if you can
provide that in the feedback that would be great otherwise at some point I
am sure I will figure it out!

Diving Deeper completed although I did not see the mockups for the progress
bar until late Sunday and although I have a solution, I decided to leave it
as is for now.

Note on feedback from Sprint-2 regarding sorting the customer array. I am
aware of the .sort method, however, you are requiring that the first three
"default" comments remain in order and their timestamps are all the same,
so that is why I wrote the orderComments function in util.js.
